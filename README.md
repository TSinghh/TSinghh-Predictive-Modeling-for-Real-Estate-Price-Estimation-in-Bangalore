# Predictive-Modeling for Real Estate Price-Estimation
Developed a predictive modeling system to estimate house prices in Bangalore using machine learning techniques. The project aimed to build an accurate and reliable model that leverages key property features such as location, total square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), and bathrooms to predict property prices. 

The system includes the following objectives:  
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Removed missing values, handled inconsistent data formats, and addressed outliers to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis. 
2. **Feature Engineering:** Created meaningful features like price per square foot and applied one-hot encoding for location-based categorization.  
3. **Outlier Removal:** Applied specific criteria, such as minimum square footage per BHK and deviations in price per square foot, to remove anomalies for better model performance.  
4. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models to identify the best-performing algorithm.
5. **Custom Prediction Functionality:** Developed a function to predict house prices dynamically based on input parameters, allowing flexibility for various user scenarios.
